Results
Throughout the four weeks of implementing this project, i have personally learnt a lot of concepts in, html, css and javascript, it has been a good experience and it has really really improved my coding skills expecially in Javascript where critical thinking is required to bring out the concepts needed in their intended order.

Conclusions
I would like to thank Mr. Ssejemba Daniel for assigning us such a project with a lot of core features that we are going to apply in other projects and also Mr. Mubiru Isaac, with my fellow colleagues for always guiding us whenever we get stuck and always willing to help me and each other whenever in need.
Finally, I want to thank the management of CodeBits Uganda Limited for the opportunity they have given us, enabling us to get us closure to the real world outside class, we are and remain ever in their debt, because we couldnt have learnt so far what we have attained, if it wasnt of there ever willingness to help us out.
